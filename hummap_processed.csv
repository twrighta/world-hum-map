The sound intensifies when I lay down in bed because it carries through the bed frame. If I go outside I can't hear it any longer. My husband can't hear it at all even if laying down. We are in a very rural area on the Kitsap peninsula with few neighbors. Our home is in a small valley surrounded by mostly coniferous trees and small hills. Our soil is predominantly clay. We live in a 1300 square foot modular ""tiny home."" We have a forced air furnace. 
Strangely and annoyingly, I heard a very similar hum intermittently while living at the Nellis Air Force base in Las Vegas, Nevada. The sound was also intermittent and rhythmic there as well. However, the frequency of hearing it has greatly increased since living here. 
I have very sensitive hearing, and I have been tested for tinnitus. I am a mental health therapist and have a masters in clinical psychology. I understand that our brain tries to make ""sense"" of sounds we find threatening. I am well equipped with relaxation strategies and also utilize white noise for masking. Neither of these strategies are successful. The only thing that helps is using uncomfortable ear phones and listening to low frequency masking and relaxation tones.

I can certainly relate to this, I hear/sense it a lot, usually late in the evening(overnight hours) when human activity comes to a halt, such as car traffic ect. and the world sleeps...but there are times during the day when I will notice it as well. 

For me, I would not say it's a rumble but more like a humming like tone. It's kind of like the humming you hear when your near one of those local electric power stations, except the tone varies in its intensity and it's a pulsing humming sound, with the tone or the humming building up, getting deeper and then going back down. Sometimes it's more subtle, other times it has a much deeper resonance to it...and it is constant, always starting low, like it's farther away and building, like a frequency wave of sorts. The only other thing I can compare it to would be like when you hear a motor/speed boat in the far off distance as it's speeding up and then slowing down and then speeds up again and slows down again, over and over again. And I'm not even sure if I'm hearing it or if I'm sensing it some other way or both. I have tried to bring it to others attention when I notice it at times but they do not always seem to notice it like I do. 

I'm wondering if it's some sort of electromagnetic energy I'm sensing, but from what I do not know. I know the Schumann resonance has been recording peaks of energy it's sensing within our planets Electromagnetic field and I'm wondering could that be what it is, could I be sensing that as well......weird I know, but then the amount of water in the human body ranges from 50-75%...and water does conduct electricity.",Low,2017,Right ear,"Sense of vibration, hmmm maybe...but not in the sense that there's a physical shaking",no,Indoors,Nighttime,Right,Yes,Yes,lost hearing in my left ear in Dec. of 2016,I have been taking blood pressure medicine and one low dose aspirin a day since Dec of 2016 when I lost hearing in my Left ear.,None,Yes,Obese,Low sensitivity,Remote house,I don't fly or travel to the mountains enough to answer that question.,Low,Not described,Non-skilled,Ongoing hearing,Never stops,Unknown,No,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Unknown,Currently medicated,No,Unknown,No,No,No,Yes,No,Unknown

I have ways of distracting myself and have just learned to cope with distraction techniques. But only successful part of my day.
Then there is a constant little jingle that plays like a horn or a kazoo that is the same damn little jingle for MONTHS now.  I could him it to you no problem. Hell I only hear it 8 billion times a day (ok probably not that many, it may not be far off though lol!). The hurt in the piercing that accompanies the baseline hum. When I envision the cause of the pain, by just closing my eyes. Its awful, so I dont do it much. But I am viewing from anothers view looking at the side of my head. I see, through said owner of eyes view, holding a long, shiny metal tool, like Surgeons use or Dentists.

Walking and driving around trying to find a source or direction has been fruitless: I can't detect any change in sound to indicate where to look. The sound seems to come from all directions equally, at least to the sensitivity of my ears. When I notice it I usually think at first that it's a a plane flying really close, but then there's no doppler - it doesn't change gradually in frequency with a ""direction"" I seem to be able to follow. It just starts and stops, with very rapid changes in volume. Times I've heard it have ranged from several minutes with repeating intervals of interminable length of relative loudness or quietness, or as constant sound with a largely consistent volume that's lasted for several hours. It's as if the sound is coming from the sky or perhaps the ground as it seems to be all around. I've looked for machine sources and even driven to a pulp and paper plant trying to trace the source to no avail.

It ranges from a low frequency rumble that feels like the bed or floor is slightly shaking (I thought the cat was itching at the foot of the bed the first time) to a higher frequency drone or buzz that I feel in my muscles like a light electrical current, and in my head, making me feel foggy and off balance.  The higher frequencies are most disturbing, I hear a whine like a wasp or a drill at the edge of my hearing, and it feels like my muscles are electrified almost.  They will randomly twitch, my stomach makes gurgling noises and cramps a bit in waves.  It scrambles my brain, it almost feels like there's pressure in my head.  It is very difficult to sleep, and when I do get bits of sleep, I have vivid bad dreams about rumbling things and wake up frequently.  My partner doesn't feel it, but one night he did mention the bed shaking a bit when it was going on, and sometimes his sleep seems disturbed when it really ramps up (though I can't be sure this isn't due to my own agitation).  Also, the house has made popping and settling noises during these sessions.  Most times it starts out with the low trembling bed shaking, then increases in frequency slowly until it is a dizzying ""wom-wom-wom"" that gets faster until it is like an electrical hum that makes me twitchy and confused and agitated.  I have only lived in this house for a month, and I have experience extreme discomfort 4 times, with lesser affects several other nights ranging from slight shaking of the bed to weird temporary fogginess.  I have only noticed it at night after 10 pm.  I only hear it in my bedroom.  I have checked appliances, checked with the neighbors about possible sources, I have searched the house and outside ( I don't hear it outside).  I have checked for possible sources nearby, such as train yards, construction, generators, utilities, etc.  There is a very small airstrip a few miles away, seems an unlikely source, and a small electrical substation maybe a half mile away, also seems unlikely.

It doesnt have a source that I can find - it seems omnipresent and never varies in pitch or volume. It momentarily blocks out with any other sound ie) rustling, talking, clicking fingers or even turning my head. Because of that, it can only be heard in quiet, still environments. When its quiet and still, the hum is very dominant. Any type of background noise blocks it though.

Just started noticing it about a year or so ago. I have called the gas company, the water company, and the electric company and all assured me that there is no issue with my utilities. The water and gas company came out and physically checked and stated this. Had an extensive talk over the phone with the electric company and was asked to turn off my main breaker and see if I still hear anything. I have twice turned all my breakers to include the main and still hear a hum. I seem to hear it more profoundly in the evening night and morning. Some days I hear it but not so much. I even hear the hum out side my home. I was told by the electric company that once the main breaker is shut off there still is a very little trickle of power that comes in. But very insignificant. In no way enough energy to do anything much less make a sound. I'm in Spartanburg SC. I've watched YouTube videos and the show The Proof Is Out There. I've researched using Google to try to find a cause of this persistent hum but with no success. If any one has an idea I'd like to hear it. I do not have ringing ears.

Consistent in that any fluctuation is subtle, albeit it's not just a consistent note or sound expression such as in a musical chord. No noticeable pattern and no pulse like sensation for me. Sometimes it can cause a slight headache for me. I've noticed when laying down, it feels like I notice external stimulai such as a shaking of my bed frame. Very subtle and slight. My experience was initially noticed about 6 months ago when I moved into a new apartment. I initially assumed this phenomena had something to do with the environment since I had no previous exposure or at least fixation on it. After initial research I believed it might be underground gas lines, since there was actual work being done in this apartment complex on very old gas lines. Debunked since for one, the sound seemed to have stopped after a period of 2 to 3 weeks. Also the hum disappeared for me up until literally last night on 10/1/24, which started around 10pm at night. This caused me to perform more research and led me to this site which I had seen on multiple videos on youtube. To note, what has helped me is a combination of external noise stimulai. Such as a fan, as well as ear plugs.  Upon the initial exposure, I had to use a combination of fan, sleep machine with white noise and ear plugs to get the vibration/hum down to something like 25%, which allowed me to fall asleep.  Lastly, I will provide a non-scientific toolset I used that in my opinion helped remediate the hum, along with other more strange optical stimulai I was experiencing around the same time.  I utilized a combination of spiritual based remedies such as palo santo/sage, salt cleansing and also Iron bell cleansing. Using heavy bells for the purification of environments has been used in a multitude of cultural religions as a protection or healing practice dating back very far in history. I only post this to provide info for this research. I am an stringent, logical minded person versed in psychology and I believe in the scientific method. That said I also am open minded and sensitive to spirituality and most important, philosophy. Perhaps my methods were coincidental in my perceived remediation, or even pychosomatic.. either way, my symptoms went away for months and now just recently returned. Lastly, I moved to the other side of my town in August, about 10 miles away from the residence where I experienced this for the first time last April.
