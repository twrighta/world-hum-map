The sound intensifies when I lay down in bed because it carries through the bed frame. If I go outside I can't hear it any longer. My husband can't hear it at all even if laying down. We are in a very rural area on the Kitsap peninsula with few neighbors. Our home is in a small valley surrounded by mostly coniferous trees and small hills. Our soil is predominantly clay. We live in a 1300 square foot modular ""tiny home."" We have a forced air furnace. 
Strangely and annoyingly, I heard a very similar hum intermittently while living at the Nellis Air Force base in Las Vegas, Nevada. The sound was also intermittent and rhythmic there as well. However, the frequency of hearing it has greatly increased since living here. 
I have very sensitive hearing, and I have been tested for tinnitus. I am a mental health therapist and have a masters in clinical psychology. I understand that our brain tries to make ""sense"" of sounds we find threatening. I am well equipped with relaxation strategies and also utilize white noise for masking. Neither of these strategies are successful. The only thing that helps is using uncomfortable ear phones and listening to low frequency masking and relaxation tones. This bothers me greatly as it interferes with my safety. My husband is a very sound sleeper and uses a cpap machine.

I can certainly relate to this, I hear/sense it a lot, usually late in the evening(overnight hours) when human activity comes to a halt, such as car traffic ect. and the world sleeps...but there are times during the day when I will notice it as well. 

For me, I would not say it's a rumble but more like a humming like tone. It's kind of like the humming you hear when your near one of those local electric power stations, except the tone varies in its intensity and it's a pulsing humming sound, with the tone or the humming building up, getting deeper and then going back down. Sometimes it's more subtle, other times it has a much deeper resonance to it...and it is constant, always starting low, like it's farther away and building, like a frequency wave of sorts. The only other thing I can compare it to would be like when you hear a motor/speed boat in the far off distance as it's speeding up and then slowing down and then speeds up again and slows down again, over and over again. And I'm not even sure if I'm hearing it or if I'm sensing it some other way or both. I have tried to bring it to others attention when I notice it at times but they do not always seem to notice it like I do. 

I'm wondering if it's some sort of electromagnetic energy I'm sensing, but from what I do not know. I know the Schumann resonance has been recording peaks of energy it's sensing within our planets Electromagnetic field and I'm wondering could that be what it is, could I be sensing that as well......weird I know, but then the amount of water in the human body ranges from 50-75%...and water does conduct electricity.",Some effort,none....but science has always interested me,2017,Yes,Right ear,"hmmmm.....not sure, because I'm not purposely or intentionally trying notice it, but when I do take notice of it it is constant, the only thing that seems to change is it's intensity as I explained above, it goes from a lower more subtle tone of humming pulse to a more intense and deeper resonance before returning back to the lower more subtle tone and starting all over again, it's constant.","hmmm...

But I have observed that the hum does not seem to be controlled by temperature (-20 C to 15 C), time of day, day of the week, snowing or raining.","From about April to October each year, I can hear the pool pump of my neighbour on the south side of my house.  The pump is off for the winter from October to April.  Aside from the pool pump, over the past 9 years, I have noticed the hum on rare occasions perhaps twice a year during the late autumn, winter or early spring.  But I never thought about it much.  As of the middle of October 2018, the hum has been continuous, variably loud, sometimes I can barely hear it, other times, like now, it is very loud outside, some sort of noise in the atmosphere coming from somewhere, but it doesn't seem to be a point source as the pool pump in the summer.  When it's more quiet, it cannot be heard outside because of other ambient noises that themselves cannot be heard inside my house, but the humming penetrates my house.","When I've been cycling for example and my ears have been affected by the wind passing by, I don't seem to hear the hum, but that's obviously because my hearing has been temporarily impaired to certain frequencies.  But after they recover, I can hear the hum again.  It is not in my ears because I cannot hear the hum inside the northern side of my house, I cannot hear any such sound at my parents' house in a different part of the city in a similar neighbourhood or at my brother's house in another city or anywhere else except inside the southern side of my house, in our neighbourhood.  Please keep in mind that I am a scientist and I am trained in detailed observations.","No. I cannot hear any such sound at my parents' house in a different part of the city in a similar neighbourhood or at my brother's house in another city or anywhere else except inside the southern side of my house, in our neighbourhood.

Therefore, my hearing is not impaired whatsoever.  When I am in a perfectly quiet place, I hear nothing in my ears (i.e. no ringing or anything like that) and I can distinguish very detailed, individual sounds from, for example, the leaves rustling in the wind, a bird chirping or a squirrel rustling in the distance, someone whispering, the subtle buzzing of my furnace on standby or an electricity transformer nearby."

It is very distinct from not the usual humming and buzzing background noise of electronics, appliances, lightbulbs, and traffic. Outside or inside doesn't much impact the intensity of the sound. Walking and driving around trying to find a source or direction has been fruitless: I can't detect any change in sound to indicate where to look. The sound seems to come from all directions equally, at least to the sensitivity of my ears. When I notice it I usually think at first that it's a a plane flying really close, but then there's no doppler - it doesn't change gradually in frequency with a ""direction"" I seem to be able to follow. It just starts and stops, with very rapid changes in volume. Times I've heard it have ranged from several minutes with repeating intervals of interminable length of relative loudness or quietness, or as constant sound with a largely consistent volume that's lasted for several hours. It's as if the sound is coming from the sky or perhaps the ground as it seems to be all around. I've looked for machine sources and even driven to a pulp and paper plant trying to trace the source to no avail.

It is very difficult to sleep, and when I do get bits of sleep, I have vivid bad dreams about rumbling things and wake up frequently.  My partner doesn't feel it, but one night he did mention the bed shaking a bit when it was going on, and sometimes his sleep seems disturbed when it really ramps up (though I can't be sure this isn't due to my own agitation).  Also, the house has made popping and settling noises during these sessions.

It's something like this: WOOM WOOM WOOM WOOM . . . .

It was only yesterday, when I decided to walk around the estate I live on at 7am, when the noise was still quite loud, that I realised I could still hear it at quite a distance from my property. However, the further away from my property I got, the less audible the sound became.

The Environmental Health Team told me to get my hearing checked out. I had a hearing test at the hospital (in a soundproof room), and was told that I have acute hearing for my age, especially in the low frequency range. The scale of the test went from 125 Hz - 8k Hz, and from just below 0 dB - 120 dB. My results were as follows: Right ear: (125 Hz, 5 dB) (From 125 to 250 Hz there is a steady increase to 0 dB) (From 250 to 500 Hz, there is a steady increase below 0 dB) ( From 500 to 1k Hz, there is a steady decrease back to 0 dB) (1k, 2k, 4k Hz, 0 dB without variation) (From 4k, there is a steady, then sudden decrease to 15 dB at 8k Hz). Left ear: (125, 250, 500, 1k Hz, 0 dB with no variation) (Between 1k and 2k Hz, there is a steady increase below 0 dB, remaining steady to roughly 3.25k Hz, before decreasing to 0 dB at 4k Hz) (From 4k Hz there is quite a steep decline to 30 dB at 8k Hz).","Medications for anxiety, HRT",None of the above,I'm sure I've had it but didn't go to the doctor,Average,"I'm not sure if this is the Hum, or, if it is, when it started. The bass noise in my property started when a new neighbour moved in next door in October 2018. At the time, he played his music 24/7, but, at first, I only heard the bass and the beat at night (the sound came through my pillow). Eventually, I contact the Environmental Health Team, but they couldn't hear anything, and said that the equipment they installed in my property did not pick up any bass sound/beat. After months of trying, and failing, to record the sound myself using various apps, I realised that my iPad had managed to record the sound, but that I had to use headphones to hear it. As such, the Environmental Health Team had to open my case again. This is still an ongoing issue. The problem is that I'm the only one who can hear this sound, and even though my neighbour admitted to playing his music through the night, he now claims he doesn't do that anymore, and thinks I'm complaining about nothing. Having read about low frequency noise, I'm aware that this is something you can become 'sensitised' to over a period of time. I fear this is what's happened to me. It was only a matter of weeks before the bass sound that I only heard from my pillow, was in my bedroom as soon as I entered the room. It was at that point that I stopped sensing the vibration of the sound. Then it was in the sitting room too, and eventually in every room in my property. I still try to record the sound when it's very loud at night, but most of the time my iPad picks up nothing. Is this the Hum? I hope not, as this has completely destroyed my life.

Consistent in that any fluctuation is subtle, albeit it's not just a consistent note or sound expression such as in a musical chord. No noticeable pattern and no pulse like sensation for me. Sometimes it can cause a slight headache for me. I've noticed when laying down, it feels like I notice external stimulai such as a shaking of my bed frame. Very subtle and slight. My experience was initially noticed about 6 months ago when I moved into a new apartment. I initially assumed this phenomena had something to do with the environment since I had no previous exposure or at least fixation on it. After initial research I believed it might be underground gas lines, since there was actual work being done in this apartment complex on very old gas lines. Debunked since for one, the sound seemed to have stopped after a period of 2 to 3 weeks. Also the hum disappeared for me up until literally last night on 10/1/24, which started around 10pm at night. This caused me to perform more research and led me to this site which I had seen on multiple videos on youtube. To note, what has helped me is a combination of external noise stimulai. Such as a fan, as well as ear plugs.  Upon the initial exposure, I had to use a combination of fan, sleep machine with white noise and ear plugs to get the vibration/hum down to something like 25%, which allowed me to fall asleep.  Lastly, I will provide a non-scientific toolset I used that in my opinion helped remediate the hum, along with other more strange optical stimulai I was experiencing around the same time.  I utilized a combination of spiritual based remedies such as palo santo/sage, salt cleansing and also Iron bell cleansing. Using heavy bells for the purification of environments has been used in a multitude of cultural religions as a protection or healing practice dating back very far in history. I only post this to provide info for this research. I am an stringent, logical minded person versed in psychology and I believe in the scientific method. That said I also am open minded and sensitive to spirituality and most important, philosophy. Perhaps my methods were coincidental in my perceived remediation, or even pychosomatic.. either way, my symptoms went away for months and now just recently returned. Lastly, I moved to the other side of my town in August, about 10 miles away from the residence where I experienced this for the first time last April.
